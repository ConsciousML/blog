# Data Science Blog

![title](images/banner.jpg)

Welcome to my blog,

I'm [Axel Mendoza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/axel-mendoza-298608121/), a machine learning engineer passionated with computer vision.
This blog has a lot of content about implementing the most used machine learning algorithms.
I wanted to add my grain of salt by creating very in-depth posts that both explain the maths and the implementation of well-known methods.
You will be able to find some nicely formatted notebooks full of explanations, latex formulas and implementation from scratch of your favorite algorithms.

Hope you enjoy it !
