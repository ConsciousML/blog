# Data Science Blog

![title](images/banner.jpg)

Welcome to my blog,

I'm [Axel Mendoza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/axel-mendoza-298608121/), a machine learning engineer passionated with computer vision.
I choosed the pseudonym ConsciousML because I'm deeply motivated to keep myself knowledgeable about IA and to give the best content I can to my fellow readers.  
This blog has a lot of content about implementing the most used machine learning algorithms.
I wanted to add my grain of salt by creating very in-depth posts that both explain the maths and the implementation of well-known machine learning methods.
You will be able to find some nicely formatted notebooks full of explanations, latex formulas and implementation from scratch of your favorite algorithms using Pytorch.

Hope you enjoy it !
